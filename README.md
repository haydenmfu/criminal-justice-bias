Analyze the COMPAS dataset 

In this research project we analyze the accuracy of the compas-two-years dataset, which contains records on criminals' age, gender, race, criminal history, and their
conmpas scores. COMPAS scores are risk scores derived from an algorithm mean to determine the risk of someone recidivating while they are on bail. By using a logistic
regression model, we can compare the assessed risk score to whether or not the defendant recidivates.
